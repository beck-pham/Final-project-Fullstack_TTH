This is a REST API I created as part of a full stack project for the www.teamtreehouse.com Full-Stack Tech Degree.

This REST API was created using Express and it provides a  way for users to adminster a school database containing information about courses.
Users can retrieve a list of courses, add upddate and delete courses. Users can make their own account and log-in and update and delete only coureses they 
own. This is the first part of a full-stack project where I will create a client for this REST API using React.
